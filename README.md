# Anaerobic Hydrocarbon Degradation Genes


Functional genes are frequently used as metabolic markers for the capacity of microbial populations to perform specific microbial activities. The use of metagenomics techniques has vastly enhanced our ability to interrogate environmental systems for such functional gene markers, but in many cases our ability to recognize requisite genes is still limited by the reference databases that are used for annotation.  Often, reference databases are fraught with misannotations or are bloated with poorly described environmental sequences for which little or no functional evidence is available. This is especially true for genes related to anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation.  

Over the last twenty-five years much has been learned about anaerobic biodegradation pathways and requisite studies have provided a wealth of information regarding potential metabolic and molecular biomarkers for environmental assessments of anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism (Callaghan, 2013). Especially with respect to the genetic data, this information is spread throughout the literature and has not been summarize in a convenient manner suitable for routine genomic/metagenomics analysis. 
This GitHub page therefore is an effort to assemble gene sequences related to anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation pathway. We note, that only full length sequences from cultivated and functionally characterized organisms were included.
